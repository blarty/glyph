<h2>HyperJars</h2>

Glyph supplies two special URL handlers that together allow for a special format of jar files called hyperjars or hjars.<br/>
Hyperjars were constructed for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>Reduce the network transport cost for mobile code</li>
<li>Allow for easier inclusion of 3<super>rd</super> party libraries as part of download files</li>
</ol>
Acheiving these two things increases the facilities that mobile code can provide and the usefulness of Localised services or smart proxies.<br/>
As an example, consider a smart proxy that communicates via SOAP, say through Axis. In general we shouldn't assume that the client of the service actually has these
classes installed or the capability, so we either build our dl jar with all the axis classes merged in or we specify multiple codebases, one for each of the axis jars we need and one for our service dl<br/>
This is unwieldy, prone to error, and inefficient. With a hyper jar we can compress all of the axis libraries, and our dl by using Pack200, and then combine them into a single jar format resulting in a hyperjar<br/>
A smaller example may include the inclusion of swing-layout.jar for ServiceUI GUIs generated through Netbeans
<h3>Why can't I scan through my code and pick out the classes I need or just use classdep?</h3>
For your own code, classdep is great because you know the make-up of your code, but in 3rd party libraries you have no idea if the classes use reflection or <i>Class.forName()</i> to
load classes dynamically - JDBC drivers can be a good example of this. Also it can be a bit of a repetitive process to work out which classes from which 3rd larty libraries you need to include.

<h3>HyperJar format</h3>
Internally a hyperjar will look similar to the following<br/>
<pre>
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
glyphaddress-dl.jar.pack
lib/
lib/swing-layout-1.0.jar.pack
</pre>
In this hjar are two packed files; <i>glyphaddress-dl.jar.pack</i> is your set of classes that would form the basis of a dl file, <i>lib/swing-layout-1.0.jar.pack</i> represents a 3<sup>rd</sup> party library.
All libraries are placed in <i>lib/</i> except for the main set of developed classes (there is no special significance to this, bar from an organizational point of view). Each of these represent packed classes.
<h3>URL formats</h3>
<h4>HJar</h4>
A Hyperjar URL looks like the following <code>hjar:&lt;otherURL&gt;!/</code>.<br/>
i.e. <code>hjar:http://localhost/mysvc-dl.hjar!/</code>  .<br/>
A HJar URL <b>must</b> have the directory (!/) specifier placed on the end; this allows the handler to know what class URLClassLoader is seeking and 
therefore work out which pack file the class is defined in.
<br/><br/><b><i>What happens if I don't specify <code>!/</code>?</i></b><br/>
<code>ClassNotFoundException</code>s get thrown; URLClassLoader will only hand you the classname it's searching for if the directory specifier is on the end, 
otherwise it will just simply ask for the stream back to a full JAR. HJar resolves to mulitple internal packed URLs, which then resolve individually to an unpacked JAR File; HJar cannot just resolve to a single stream
so it needs to know what Class is being searched for.<br/><br/>
<b><i>Is there any other way to specify Hjar URLs without the !/ and for everything to work correctly?</i></b><br/>
You can override the RMIClassLoaderSPI to load a ClassProvider that extends PrefferedClassProvider, and checks the initial URLs coming in to see if they have the directory specifier on the end, and if
it's absent add it to the URL before it's passed to URLClassLoader.<br/><br/>
<b><i>So why don't we do that?</i></b><br/>
Because it means patching jsk-resources, which we do for the URL handlers, but for RMIClassLoaderSPI we would overwrite something rather than append, and for some people that
already override RMIClassLoaderSPI with their own implementations (say containers), could mean breaking their code. Keeping the changes in the URL format  is simpler, and less risky
<h4>Pack</h4>
In general, you are unlikely to use the pack: handler directly (the hjar: handler delegates to it internally). But it is easily done<br/>
The format is <code>pack:&lt;otherURL&gt;!/</code>
<a name="builder"/>
<h2>Building Hyperjars</h2>
Hyperjars are built using the hyperjarbuilder jar<br/>
Once you have run your ant build and created your dl jar(s), you can then use the hyperjar ant task to compress and put your class file and libraries in to hjar format ancd generate the hjar jar file
i.e. <pre>&lt;target name="init">
		&lt;fileset id="mypath" dir="lib">
			&lt;include name="swing*.jar" />
		&lt;/fileset>
		&lt;fileset id="mypath2" dir="d:/development/libs">
			&lt;include name="log4j.jar" />
		&lt;/fileset>
	&lt;/target>
	&lt;target name="dist" depends="init">
		&lt;hjar classesJar="dist_test/lib-dl/glyphqaddress-dl.jar" destfile="dist/lib/glyphaddress-dl.hjar">
			&lt;fileset refid="mypath" />
			&lt;fileset refid="mypath2" />
		&lt;/hjar>
	&lt;/target>
</pre>

You can specify multiple filesets. If you use the apt generator, this xml file will be generated along with the classdep file, and will automatically pack your classdepand jar output file
if you specify the <b>hjarlibs</b> option , see the <a href="building.html">building</a> page for more details.
