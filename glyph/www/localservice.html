<h2>Creating fully local services</h2>
<p>Local services are services that are placed into a Lookup Service without an exported component in them. Whereas remote Services (as sepcified by the @Service annotation)
have a remote 'backend' that method calls are sent to. Local Services allow you to use mobile code to deploy different communication mechanisms into the client, whilst managing the service from the service deployer 
on a remote machine; for instance, a proxy is placed in the LUS that uses SOAP calls to talk to an XML service under the covers, whilst the service can periodically check that the web service is available, 
and withdraw the service proxy for new clients if necessary</p>

<h3>Defining a Local Service</h3>
<p>You define a local service by placing the @LocalService attribute on your implementation code:</p>
<code>@LocalService<br/>
public class MyLocalImpl implements MyLocal {</code><br/>

<p>By default a LocalService is not automatically administrable, because removing the service, does not stop a client with an exisiting copy of the local service using it's facilities.
To enable administration, change the annotation to <code>@LocalService( administrable=true)</code></p>
Because the LocalService is sent to the client, it must be Serializable, and the implementation class will be added to the classdepandjar list.
