<h2>Defining UIs for your services</h2>
With Jini, you can bind a ServiceUI factory to your service as a lookup attribute, and ServiceUI-aware applications, such as service browsers can detect the attribute and pass the service to the factory.
The factory can then create a UI Component (Panel, Frame, etc.) at the client application and bind the service object to the clien, such that an interface to the service is
downloaded and installed into the client on demand<br/>
Essentially this is done via the UIFactory  and the UIRole (Admin, Main or About). The UI Factory class implements a particular type of Service UI UIFactory interface, which will create the Component
and return it to the caller for display.<br/>
<h3>@ServiceUI</h3>
<p>The @ServiceUI annotation is responsible for generating the factory code, and adding the UI to the list that will later be added to the Services AttributeBuilder.<code>AttributeBuilder</code> is a set of 
Lookup Attributes that are added at runtime, after the user defined ones are loaded from the services configuration file.
</p>
<p>When you use the @ServiceUI annotation you may specify a role, and an id, and a factory (if required); as follows</p>
<p><code>@ServiceUI<br/>
public class HelloPanel extends JPanel {</code><br/>
or <code>
@ServiceUI(role="admin", id="service1")<br/>
public class HelloPanel extends JPanel {</code>
</p><p>The <b>role</b> is one of 'admin', 'main' or 'about', and defaults to main (These each relfect one of the ServiceUI <code>UIDescriptor</code> roles), 
and the id attribute refers to one of your service <a href="service.html#identifiers">identifiers and defaults to 'default'</a>.
What the<b>direct</b> superclass is of your serviceUI component, affects the type of Factory that is created.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tr><th>Component's superclass is...</th><th>UIFactory is...</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Dialog</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.DialogFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Frame</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.FrameFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Panel</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.PanelFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Window</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.WindowFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JDialog</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.JDialogFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JFrame</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.JFrameFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JWindow</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.JWindowFactory</td></tr>
	<tr><td>.....</td><td>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.JComponentFactory</td></tr>
</table>
<br/>
In the examples above, it doesn't match anything and so defaults to JComponentFactory which is fine for our JPanel

<p>You can override this by spcecifying the type of component factory you want to use, by using the <code>factory</code> attribute i.e</p>
<code>
@ServiceUI(role="admin",  factory="JFrame")<br/>
public class MyServiceFrame extends MyCompanyBaseJFrame {</code>

<h3>Generated code</h3>
The ServiceUI annotation generates the factory class, and a snippet that is used in the AttributeBuilder, after all you may have more than one serviceUI generated for a service (perhaps an AdminUI and a MainUI).
It also tags these classes and the class that the annotation is one as being required to be placed in the <a href="http://classdepandjar.dev.java.net">classdepandjar</a> <code>topclass</code> section.

<h2>Notes</h2>
You will need to add all necessary constructors that are used by the Factory and the first parameter to each constructor will be an instance of <code> net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</code>
